# The process i used
The process i used when working on this project is as follows:
1. Create a python script that extracts data related to that stock, the api used was gotten from yfinance.
2. The python script should be given a time range (i used 10 years range), and the data extracted should be saved in either a csv or excel file.
3. With the extracted data (the stock data i used was GOOGL stock), you can begin applying data science on the project.
